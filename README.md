<p align="center">Entangled-IO is a set of developer tools, designed to bridge the gap between client and server applications written in typescript. With simple helpers on the backend, and webpack-plugin on the front, you can effectively call functions from server-side apps as if they were local within your client-side apps.</p>
<br/>

## Installation

For a server application using express.
```
npm install @entangled/express
npm link
```

For a client application using webpack.
```
npm install @entangled/webpack
npm link my-service
```

<br/>

## Abstract

Entangled-IO, when added to a project using typescript, allows you to `import` and call within one app, functions which only really exist on another. It combines web-hosting and a special type of `export`, to create what we'll call `window-functions`, an abstraction on top of a pretty neat compiler trick. üé©üê∞

In-use, a window function and it's import/export between apps, *is not real*, but a handy neumonic to help you and your bundler (such as [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)) establish a form of API. With the concept, we can auto-generate code to implement these functions on a client (at runtime, where actual logic is unavailable) using http instead.

A compiler plugin helps with this by replacing, in your client code, what would otherwise be [illegal imports](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/028/207/Screen_Shot_2019-01-17_at_4.22.43_PM.jpg) from linked node app (since obviously, "remote" modules can't be bundled). In their place, a thin client is added, to mediate between client and host. As "imported" functions are used, `fetch` requests are actually used under-the-hood, sent to an *"entangled"* endpoint, which runs the real functions on the clients' behalf!

This makes server interop more-or-less free to develop. It can be hard work, defining endpoints, directing [request-like libraries](https://github.com/request/request/issues/3143#issue-427486416), keeping them bug-free, and especially so to [maintain a codec](https://dev.to/peterszerzo/safe-functional-io-in-typescript-an-introduction-1kmi). Entangled is built to automate all of that, as a thin, portable, **and inherently type-safe** ‚òùÔ∏è collection of async window-fuctions.

<br/> 

### The TL;DR

- Call remote functions as if directly on a client
- Skip explicitly writing REST handlers for your services
- Access resources using simple async functions, not requests
- Avoid packing and unpacking potentially complex data
  > Arguments and returned data are serialized and reassembed for you on both sides, so even deeply nested objects and arrays are safe and easy to send and recieve. <br/>
- Special objects do not need special handling
  > Transmitting `Date` objects traditionally for instance, is usually tedius, but here it's automatic. <br/>
  > No more `let d = date && new Date(date);` nonsense. <br/>
- **Type signatures are preserved!** 
  > Because you simply "import" the actual server functions, your IDE remains aware of their signature, and so covered is the natural blind-spot for autocomplete and static type-checking.
- Errors thrown by the server (in development) are merged with ones thrown on the client
  > Sometimes, it can be inconvenient or even impossible to inspect console output from where your functions are running, such as within a container or serverless environment. This makes that a non-issue via a shared stack-trace.

<br/>

Taking a wholistic approach, you can focus more on the business logic of your stack, rather than its communication layer. <br/> This way, both can grow quickly and organically with little in the way of debugging or type maintainance.

<br/>

## Setup

It takes very little to get up and running. You start by linking your node app (using preference of [NPM](https://www.deadcoderising.com/how-to-smoothly-develop-node-modules-locally-using-npm-link/) or [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/link/)) to client apps. A good practice is to add the module as a dev-dependancy as well. 

> [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) and/or [yarn-workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/) can be used to accomplish the same thing if you're into monorepos!
> 
> However, while optional, configuring certain modules with a [Typescript project reference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) is a good idea. It causes your IDE to consider the `src/` of your project for types, rather than generated `d.ts` files. This can greatly enhanse the responsiveness of your type-checker, and assist with procedures (such as `Go to definition` and `Rename Symbol`).

**Remember**: *Declarations still are required* for both the development and production builds of any server module used.

<br/>

<h2>Hello World &nbsp;<sup>(In 5 easy steps)</sup></h2>

The following is pretty much all you'll need to implement a simple round trip between node and a browser application.

<br/>

<b>1.</b> &nbsp; Let's make a sever which can say hi.  ü§ñ‚úåÔ∏è

> `my-service/index.ts`

```typescript
/* First we'll import a helper for whatever platform you're already using. */

import Interface from '@entangled/express';

/* Next, define functions to do or return whatever you like. */

async function sayHi(name = "World"){
  return `Hello ${name}!`
}

/* Now for the easy part.
   Create an interface with a map of functions you wish to expose.
   You can organize them, into routes, too via nesting! */

const api = new Interface({ sayHi });

/* Launch the resulting interface as an endpoint at runtime.
   Here, `listen` will create an Express instance for you, and attach functions to "/".
   You could spread into an existing express app if you wanted to though! */

api.listen(8080); 

/* Most importantly; export the resuting namespace for consumer projects to access. */

export = api; 
```

<br/>

<b>2.</b> &nbsp; Now onto the client, add your service module as a **dev-dependancy**. You'll also need to link it.

> `my-app/package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "devDependancies": {
    "my-service": "0.0.0"
  }
}
```

<br/>

<b>3.</b> &nbsp; Add the `ApiReplacementPlugin` to your plugins, passing in the name of any modules exporting an Interface.<br/>

> `my-app/webpack.config.js`

```js
const { EnvironmentPlugin } = require("webpack");
const ApiReplacementPlugin = require("@entangled/webpack");

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new ApiReplacementPlugin(["my-service"]),
    new EnvironmentPlugin({ ENDPOINT: "http://localhost:8080/" })
  ]
}
```

<blockquote>By default, your endpoint's <i>protocol</i>, <i>domain</i>, <i>port</i>, and <i>root</i> are derived from var <code>ENDPOINT</code>, defined on your env.<br/> 
Use <code><a href="https://webpack.js.org/plugins/environment-plugin/">EnvironmentPlugin</a></code> to inject that into your build as well. (We provide a default value too, in this example.)</blockquote>

<br/>

<b>4.</b> &nbsp; We now have everything we need, to run server functions on the client! Just import away. ‚ú®

> `my-app/demo.jsx`

```tsx
/* Import the servce module and interface we've made there. */

import API from "my-service"

async function sayHello(event){
  const name = prompt("What is your name?", "World");

  /* Call and await a remote-function like you would any other thenable!
     It will fetch the corresponding resource (invoking your function) under the hood. */

  let response = await API.sayHi(name);

  /* Oh, and you might notice we still have type inference, even in non-ts files! üòç */

  event.currentTarget.innerText = `Server said ${response}`;

  /* Enjoy your day ‚òïÔ∏è */
}

export default () => (
  <div onClick={sayHello}>
    Click me to say hi to the server!
  </div>
)
```

> Note: [`esModuleInterop`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56348146) is set to true for this module, which substitues `*` for `default`. <br/> You might want to destructure your functions/routes instead however, which should be the norm for larger APIs anyway.

<br/>

<b>5.</b> &nbsp;  Host and Click. "*Server said Hello Moto*" üòé

<br/>

## Why does this work?

At runtime, having crawled the functions you provided, `@entangled/express` defines the route: <br>
`POST //0.0.0.0:8080/sayhi` on whatever backend you set up.

At the same time in your browser app, a copy of `@entangled/client` replaced `my-service` via webpack, but tweaked to export instead window-functions with the signature:
```ts
{ sayHi: (name?: string) => Promise<string> }
```

> This will always reflect an `Interface` exported by you. 

When called, the runtime goes to work to bundle and send your arguments (if there are any) to a route expected to match your function.

If all goes well, your backend receives the request, to then reformat and `apply` to a real function. <br/> 
Much the same occures for the response, and *voila* the client's promise resolves an actual, returned value! 

And all of your glue-code: `‚§µ`<br/>

## Packages

### `@entangled/webpack`

> This plugin lets webpack consume some dependancy (better put, a devDependancy) as a remote module. Webpack wil scan that import for it type definitions (`d.ts` files). An adaptor is then injected to replace those exported function with `fetch` calls, all to paths corresponding to the original.

### `@entangled/fetch`

> A client adaptor for your browser apps. Webpack relies on this for serialization and to inteface with the real endpoint serving your functions for actual use.

### `@entangled/interface`

> Webpack and the server adaptor rely on this to discover and parse `d.ts` files in order to properly mirror your IO. It tries to be aware of your actual arguments' types for purposes of conversion and error detection (coming soon). This is also, most-importantly responsible for conveying TS bindings to consumers properly.

### `@entangled/express`

> Consuming an arbitarily deep map of functions, this plugin (specifically for express apps) will expose all given as live-resources for consumer adaptors to bind to at runtime.


<br/>

## Try it out! 

> Provided is an exmaple you can try out for yourself!

```
git clone git@github.com:gabeklein/entangled-io.git
cd entangled-io
npm install
npm run example
```

> This will launch both a server (on port 8080) and dev-server (port 3000) for the client, demoing a simple interaction you can play with!
>
> Demo is accessible at [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) after starting.
